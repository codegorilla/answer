# SysSock.Use: Turn off message reception via local log socket; local messages
# are retrieved through imjournal now.
module(load="imuxsock" SysSock.Use="off")

# Provides access to the systemd journal
# StateFile: File to store the position in the journal
module(load="imjournal" StateFile="imjournal.state")

# Reads kernel messages (the same are read from journald)
#module(load="imklog")

# Provides --MARK-- message capability
#module(load"immark")

# Provides UDP syslog reception
#module (load="imudp")
#input (type="imudp" port="514")

# Provides TCP syslog reception
module (load="imtcp")
input (type="imtcp" port="{{ syslog_port }}")

# GLOBAL DIRECTIVES

# ### begin forwarding rule ###
# The statement between the begin ... end define a SINGLE forwarding
# rule. They belong together, do NOT split them. If you create multiple
# forwarding rules, duplicate the whole block!
# Remote Logging (we use TCP for reliable delivery)
#
# An on-disk queue is created for this action. If the remote host is
# down, messages are spooled to disk and sent when it is up again.
#$ActionQueueFileName fwdRule1 # unique name prefix for spool files
#$ActionQueueMaxDiskSpace 1g   # 1gb space limit (use as much as possible)
#$ActionQueueSaveOnShutdown on # save messages to disk on shutdown
#$ActionQueueType LinkedList   # run asynchronously

# remote host is: name/ip:port, e.g. 192.168.0.1:514, port optional
